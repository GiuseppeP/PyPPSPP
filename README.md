# Open Source implementation of PPSPP protocol [RFC7574]

This repository contains an open-source Python3 based implementation of the Peer-to-Peer Streaming Peer protocol, that I am using in my PhD studies.

This repository contains two folders - the PPSPP implementation and a simple tracker server that can be used to bootstrap the clients.

Updates, questions, pull-requests and refactoring is more than welcome.
